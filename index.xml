      <description>I have been working as a software engineer since 2007.
I have developed, managed, analysed enterprise applications and solutions in many companies. I mainly use C# as my primary programming language but can work with other OOP languages either.
I have specialized at back-end and performance optimizations in applications. I actively participate in deployments, management and optimizations in projects and can easily identify myself as DevOps.</description>
